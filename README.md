##### LANGUAGES
- French (45%); at school, with my school friends, well you know, I live in France.
- English (40%); at home, with my family members, with my collaborators (some of them speak in English, so... no choices).
- Sinhalese (10%); that's my native language, but I don't use it everyday. My parents did force me to speak in Sinhalese, but I was not fan of it. Thus, I don't really know how to speak my native language fluently. Fortunatly, we do speak in English in Sri Lanka :)
- German (5%); in german class.
